# Anywhere To-Do
A simple chrome extension that allows you to add new tasks from any tab in the browser. 
I built this simple extension as a 1 day project to help me quickly note down new tasks while being in any tab in my chrome browser.

## How it Works
1. Download the extension from the chrome webstore
2. It should replace your old new tab. 
> Chrome will ask to keep changes or not. **Select keep changes**

3. After this, from any tab (not specifically new tab), you should be able to add new tasks to the todo list.
4. Click on the address bar and use the keyword *:todo* then press space/tab to trigger the extension.
5. Enter your amazing task and press enter. You should see the changes, next time you open a new tab.

**The data will sync between all chrome sessions and all your devices**

## Version

#### Ver 0.3.1
* Fixed bug where new tasks are not added from a different tab while the extension tab is closed.

#### Ver 0.3
* Fixed bug where if you delete a task it would delete the task after.
